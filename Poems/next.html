  <h1><i> The Road Not Taken </i></h1>
  <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
  And sorry I could not travel both<br>
  And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
  And looked down one as far as I could<br>
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

  <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
  And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
  Though as for that the passing there<br>
  Had worn them really about the same,</p>

  <p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
  In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
  Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
  I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

  <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
  Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
  Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
  I took the one less traveled by,<br>
  And that has made all the difference.</p>
