    <h1> <i> Lice On The Loose </i></h1>

    <p> <em> Last week our teachers called it quits
        <br>
        We all went home, how nice!
        <br>
        The school came to a standstill
        <br>
        With a festival of lice..
        <br>
        No-one knows how it all started
        <br>
        Or who brought in the nits,
        <br>
        But pretty soon every head in the class
        <br>
        Got a bathtime tea-tree blitz!

        <br>
        <br>
        Despite the frantic washing 
        <br>
        Even shaving of the hair,
        <br>
        The nits kept right on propping
        <br>
        Baby lice out everywhere!
        <br>
        Meanwhile on the WhatsApp groups
        <br>
        The moms were getting mean,
        <br>
        Naming, shaming or spouting cures
        <br>
        Like liquid praffin!
